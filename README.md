# Advent of Code (2022)
Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.

You can read more about it, or participate, here: https://adventofcode.com/2022/about

Where possible, I'll attempt to solve these in the `R` programming language, using `tidyverse`.
